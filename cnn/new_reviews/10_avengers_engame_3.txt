I have given a lower rating to this movie in the context of a follow up to infinity war. I cannot believe the hype and positive critical reviews given to this movie. There are some glaring plot holes that just cannot be ignored like Steve Rogers going back in time and preferring to live an ordinary life with Peggy Carter and never being Captain America! The God of Thunder and the big angry Hulk being reduced to a laughing stock. The supporting villains seem to have absolutely no impact whatsoever rendering them redundant. and finally Thanos - the most refreshing and complex characters of IW being reduced to a generic villain. Robert Downing Junior is the one saving grace of the movie.
