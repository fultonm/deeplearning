Was this episode visually appealing? YES. Could the script for this episode be better? YES.

If you just want action, lots of fighting and explosions then this is the episode you are going to enjoy. But if you want a logical story line without plot holes, a poor plot amour and strong character development (or endings), then no. The story line is very obviously rushed and you can tell that D&D has put little thought into writing a script that could match the levels of the earlier seasons, instead they opted for a more cinematic approach with impressive visuals.
