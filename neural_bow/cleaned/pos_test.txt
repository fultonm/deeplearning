actually fan original liveactiondisney flick name starring hayley mills twice pair twins separated birth divorcing parents never come contact parents never meet everyone know feel remakes especially films happen enjoy fallacy unless youre going either capture exact spirit original something different maybe even wrack brain come gasp new idea remake originally top viewing list actually quite opposite contemporary liveactiondisney films one favorties anyway theyre usually unfunny alienating big fat bore least anyone age iq one however shockingly bad fact actually good original good whats great doesnt necessarily retread original capture exact spirit become entertaining exact reasons original entertaining cute innocent fun pretty killer plot endlessly fun follow along lead star immensely appealing parents also immensely appealing im repeating cute innocent fun theres nothing risque save plot idea separating twins denying truth years ominously selfish precisely point movie aimed directly either kids adults want remember original young adults want remember like kid personally somewhere second third vividly remember taste movies wasnt weird diverse names godard kubrick werent even glimmer right eye back would tune every sunday night couple years see abcs wonderful world disney theyd show liveaction andor madefortv disney flick hour per week remember mom taking sister along friends mothers see rereleased disney films like lady tramp pinnochio sadly remember every single christmas without fail barage childrens animated halfhour shows made exclusively christmas season wouldnt dare missing even remember seeing madefortv parent trap ii tv one night seen one saw original parent trap late childhood movie deals issue divorce deals disneyized version playful witty charming saw first time right never experienced part childhood id probably dismiss id probably new version movie hadnt seen original perfect age watching could remember fun watch disney film divorce started get thinking possibilities seeminglyperfect parents splitting affected adolescence also brushed fear smooth stroke pointed even fuckedup situations things could always work well manipulate things bit least better new version also charming way new cast contemporary feel first time awhile liveactiondisney flick tone isnt corny condescending right moments would otherwise seem corny actually affecting safe kind way first time since original film kids actually know better foolish adults story basically classic repeated almost many times kurosawas seven samurai pair twins played lindsay lohan like played hayley mills original separated birth divorcing parents one annie sent live mother natasha richardson resembling mother vanessa redgrave ever noticed london lives parents devoted foppish butler simon kunz works swingin fashion designer grows refined classy also keen knowledge sports pokerplaying hallie sent northern california father dennis quaid live vineyard pseudomaid lisa ann walter grows rugged yet charming meet camp one annie wants go become rugged feud look alltoo similar thus tight competition results nasty pranks winds seclusion together private outoftheway cabin become friends learn eachother know everything concoct scheme switch places one meet parent theyve heard learn eachothers lives detail make sure look alike requires hair cutting notoriously earpiercing scene like kiddie version hypodermic needle scene pulp fiction end summer comes switch hope best lindsay lohan doesnt necessarily copy acting style hayley mills original comes appealing though add couple new things makes california twin little appealing london twin bit frank snobbish snotty proper original respectively also adds american british accent one one faking accent throughout really take notice see fake ones accents arent exactly perfect shes also incredibly appealing merely cute especially notable since first feature film know notorious child actors especially first films makes great protagonist helps supporting cast equally appealing dennis quaid fact hasnt likable decade big dumb smile near cocky attitude made notable actor past hes mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except hasnt ever likable period two make winning couple maybe winning maureen ohara late brian keith original still work film instead bickering ensued original film adds another dimension another angle characters amiss original opening credits see glimpses courtship fall quickly madly love eachother back together films smarmy scenes come actually sentimental great way migraineinducing way many films brings new parent trap level entertainment hasnt really existed since well original film years ago still money best liveactiondisney flick time form intelligence wit makes plot points otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot golddigging sharon stone type played elaine hendrix whos deliciously tormented twins later film treat instead bore like original film transcends crap well could case point takes two starring olsen twins treats children smart ones adults silly ones way around everything knows exactly charming without biting chew however comparison original could bit better certain scenes work well nearly well worked original liked way parents fought past dilemnas fought falling love better liked watching two old flames getting back together bottle wine somehow feuding always cinematic pleasing mere reminscing lesson extracted howard hawkscary grant films yesteryear much film transcends mere cutedom compared original film almost drowns cutedom original though gritty far stylized suitable adult audiences young audiences remake may never nearly great classic original film least knows treat source material dignity respect create virtually effects without bordering plagerism petty annoyances

seems like really long time norton walks film though coming intensity reduces anyone adequate job rubble fifth movie career norton invented one reliable intense actors generation maybe best theres nothing like norton really gets rolling movie spewing lines authority commands attention audience coming power similar young maron brando allows little emotions seep amazing sadly enough isnt going great portrait racism perhaps hopes unambitious even little contrived really take either powerful statement emotional masterpiece ending especially pencilled movies tossed emotional keyboard trounced upon skinheads reduced mere cliches kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly fat skinhead whose lines consist without fail expressing desire eat even dramatic arc isnt well travelled

beliefs one see director tony kaye wanted name removed sorta american history good movie moved could lot better problem seems cut claims potential somewhere claims lies tony kaye cut true cut viewed norton ordered another cut thus although aimed directing credit go alan smithee resident name film disowned director wasnt allowed grounds disown film badmouth really thats macguffin one really wanted film good given alan smithee sign disapproval kayes right par even hes referring normal par rather personal par right thing late yet still gets point across intelligently backs story message one

believe one rest cast fine though often work iffy dialogue lucas neeson perfect aging jedi knight mcgregor wellcast obiwan conveys balance youthful energy calm sensibility portman fits role young queen well lines often formal giving little room give character much personality biggest problem phantom menace plot characters interaction individually characters new film less developed original
