fellow critic stated belief reviewer speak review ive attempted obey rule recent months would impossible case fact nearly every person goes see phantom menace brings baggage original star wars trilogy means much many people calibrated creativity child masterful original works art mix moving stories astonishing special effects time still hold pretty darn well young seen star wars theater original release doesnt make less dedicated contrary star wars trilogy empire strikes back particular three items short list love movies heard george lucas would making first trilogy ninefilm series got exited first saw screenshots film well year ago embarked yearlong drool anticipation first previews released last thanksgiving ready see film hype insane marketing campaign lucasfilms secretive snobbery picture last weeks picture opened multitudes fans waited outside theaters stood boiling sun days advance first ones theater tired hearing tired seeing cardboard cutouts characters whenever went kfc taco bell wanted see movie reader misunderstand antihype reaction hype unavoidable understand accept hype happens prequel widely beloved films time get released five minutes phantom menace knew problem jedi knights asked churning stale dialogue machinegun rapidity arent characters developed adventures special effects shot nearly every frame entire film questions early later asked wheres magic first three films looking watch every fifteen minutes end film tired maddened depressed george lucas funneled wonderful movies pointless mindless summer blockbuster phantom menace star wars film take away title jedi talk force youre left easily one vacuous special effects movies time embarrassment looked desperately scene character explored new theme examined special effects shot isnt used theyre token attempts fact george lucas created simultaneously abysmally bad excuse movie pretty good showcase digital effects wanted see didnt want leave phantom menace headache bitter taste mouth story centers mostly around quigon jinn liam neeson looking lost confused apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor scarcely line film attempts liberate people planet naboo naboo victim bureaucratic war trade federation contact naboo queen amidala natalie portman teenage ruler truly cares people picking jar jar binks completely cgi character voiced ahmed best head tatooine meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd mother pernilla august quigon knows force strong young anakin jedi knights take boy journeys bad guys darth maul darth sidious neither enough lines register characters isnt anything particularly wrong story looking synopsis form way lucas handled however unsatisfactory first dont learn one single thing quigon jinn one thing life like film well imagine didnt one thats feels like plot device probably explains neeson looks hopeless role hes recently retired film dont blame honestly obiwan character really looking forward learning even less interesting mcgregor lines anyone hoping see engaging young actor great performance urged look elsewhere since two men focus phantom menace lucas served us big emotional void centerpiece movie things start pick characters reach tatooine young anakin perhaps truly fleshedout character film lloyd thoughtful job role also hugely impressed sand speeder scene rarely action sequence fast exciting anakin says goodbye mother found moving also fairly good portman manages give little depth character depth written jar jar binks one annoying characters ive ever endure hes interesting humans soon relativelybrief segment tatooine back mindnumbing special effects depthless action scenes ive seen many movies qualify special effects extravaganzas phantom menace first one ive seen sick special effects fifteen minutes movie reason obvious george lucas restraint cant say didnt find effects original final battle darth maul obiwan quigon visually exceptional film also found effects deadening tiresome breaking point near end picture anakin getting questioned yoda jedi masters background see hundreds digital spaceships flying around digital sky wanted go away cant one stinking scene isnt bursting seems special effects shot got sick looking cgi characters spaceships planets backgrounds really wanted go outside look physical landscape hours theres question magic lost sixteen years phantom menace return jedi feeling lucas focused movie looked forgot entirely way feel john williams familiar score help lucas direction think comes right characters none longed magnetic presence han luke leia got thing ridiculous expectations mine werent high simply wanted film showed roots films grew loving story characters great special effects instead got two hours fifteen minutes lifeless imaginative computer graphics show dont hate phantom menace much resent id like forget exists yet cant stay hope episodes ii iii something substance dont lucas pulled impossible task destroying indestructible series

anything stigmata taken warning releasing similarlythemed films relatively close one another four supernatural horror flicks released year clearly worst suppose seen coming blair witch thoroughly creeped sixth sense mildly spooky stir echoes moments wasnt anything id lose sleep clearly quality horror summer slowly dropping surprise stigmata dullest horribly executed piece mtvinfluenced tripe seen long really patricia arquette plays frankie page hairdresser pittsburgh receives rosary gift globetrotting mother turns rosary belonged recentlydeceased brazilian priest priests church investigation father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne mysterious appearance bleeding statue father kiernan investigator made career disproving supposed religious signs time believes something bleeding statue investigation soon called however frankie starts exhibiting signs stigmata person inflicted wounds like jesus christ father kiernan initially skeptical frankie story considering shes atheist witnesses stigmata attacks dedicates finding going eventually begins suspect boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce concealing something could bring catholic church turns dead priest working translation fifth gospel excommunicated new rupert wainwright music video mean film stigmata sort film starts ok gets worse indeed would good music video interesting five minutes im sure wainwright trying prove endless parade slowmotion doubleexposure extreme closeups whoaaaaaa fact swelled head director hollywood yes film school camera trickery interesting little eventually becomes headacheinducing film needed second audio track played dialogue wainwright screaming audience see look im excellent director maybe hed explain decided start half scenes slowmotion shots water dripping reverse included random superfluous shots egg frying ooh scary underlying meaning behind camera trickery didnt see thought safe get involved story comes doubleexposure shot two patricia arquettes collapsing bed reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh superfluous camera trickery wouldnt bother stigmata story characters remotely engaging though wainwrights vanity certainly doesnt help seem given nearly unworkable script plot continuity character development need case point frankie page character assume supposed identify sympathize arent given back story character reason like extent character development seems hardworking hairdresser somehow afford cavernous apartment top floor building shes kind cute lets start bleeding fact shes clearly brightest bulb drawer doesnt help either according frankie page first thing receiving mysterious wounds wrists back go clubbing sure makes sense arquette byrne pryce give old college try characters onedimensional appear sleepwalking scenes arquette byrne probably supposed sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat setup romantic subplot clumsily handled almost reaches point becoming laughable even though frankie pages life falling apart eyes still finds time hit priest wanders hair salon even curiously seems interested advances father andrews religious doubt pops suddenly seems silly dramatic pryce may well wear curled mustache cackle ill get pretty depth cardinal houseman afforded trust im revealing anything telling pryce turns villain whats worse faced dull characters prospect annoying camera tricks loud music jammed throats contend story starts one direction veers another another ends totally incomprehensible first film doesnt even bother explain simple plot details frankie get stigmata merely touching rosary come atheist like chosen since father andrew mentions devout believers ever received stigmata actually im sure frankie posessed supposedly stigmata occurs one posessed holy spirit film later posessed dead priest later evil spirit think one answer question course simple possessing entity scene determined whichever effects flashy camera work mr wainwright wants use time furthermore ending ridiculously neat little wrapup filmmakers compound problem ultimately turning film diatribe catholic church research gospel st thomas youll find suppressed church film seems claim readily available local library theres nothing catholics need worry though stigmatas religion offbase cant confused anything remotely resembling real catholic church wanted portray catholic priests mobsters gone allout equipped sharkskin suits tommy guns would far interesting im catholic fact care much catholic church cartoonish misrepresentation film considered realistic means rare see film fails many levels stigmata thoughtprovoking though would like definitely scary though pretends im sure tried pass horror film absolutely nothing scary story maybe attempt cover fact none scenes dramatic weight whatsoever initial shock seeing arquette covered blood dulled fact happens like many films mtv generation one suffers overkill much overdone stigmata eventually effect audience leaving us pick films
