If the show runners wanted SO BADLY to resolve the story via "The Mad Queen" narrative, they needed more than 4 episodes to build up to it. When the surrender bells rang out and Dany made the decision to burn down King's Landing, I literally had to restart the episode to see if there was something I was missing. You spent 7 seasons building a character up to be merciful, intelligent, and graceful. You really expect the audience to forget all of that after 4 episodes of half-baked "Dany won't listen to anyone!" scenes? Simply put- when she decided to do that, it made no sense. It needed to. The moment of the show with the most kairos failed for me, and I am honestly a little sad that I wasted so many years on this show. I'm going to just imagine the show ended after Season 6 and be content.

The only reason I have any stars was to give credit where credit is due. The stunt coordinators, special effects team, and set designers did an incredible job. I just wish it was on a better episode.
